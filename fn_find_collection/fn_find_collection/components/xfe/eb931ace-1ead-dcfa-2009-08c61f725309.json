As with previous campaigns, the initial infection source was websites' relation to news in the targeted regions; however, instead of leveraging compromised, legitimate news sites, OceanLotus stood up their own websites. The content on the website appears to have been obtained via legitimate news sources, which Volexity believes is automatically done through a WordPress plugin. Some websites include malicious content on the majority of pages while others include the code only on specific pages, the latter of which are likely used in more targeted attacks where the link is sent via spear phishing messages. The infected pages executed two scripts, one to capture and store information and the other to display a malicious download link. Depending on the type of device the victim is visiting the page from, different links may be displayed. On mobile devices, a link that is currently offline is provided, but Volexity believes that at one point a phishing page was hosted there. On Windows systems, a fake Flash Player download is provided. On all other systems, an error message is displayed. In the case of Windows hosts, the sample analyzed by the researchers led to the download of a RAR archive containing a legitimate copy of Google's Update utility (masquerading as the Adobe Flash installer) and a malicious DLL. DLL side-loading is used to execute the malicious code when the legitimate executable is opened. The DLL loads a Cobalt Strike stager into memory that, in turn, downloads a Cobalt Strike Beacon from a C2 server.
