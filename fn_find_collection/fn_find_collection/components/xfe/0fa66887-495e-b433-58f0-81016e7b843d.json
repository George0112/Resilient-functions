According to Unit 42, between May and September 2020, an average of 65,000 HTML pages and 24,000 unique URLs have been compromised by some form of web skimmers. Formerly focused in the retail arena, web skimmers have become more prevalent on the internet in recent years. Most often attacked, the U.S. is a prime target for web skimmers due to the rise in e-commerce and the work-from-home crowd due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From credit cards to usernames and passwords, these skimmers are seeking all types of information that could prove useful to a threat actor. In fact, the U.S. made up 61.78% of detected URLs according to statistics provided by Unit 42. The report states that at least 63 different malware families use some form of web skimming in their operations with 19 families making up the vast majority of these. Understanding how web skimmers operate is paramount in defending against them. Most web skimmers are complex and polymorphic in nature. Using JavaScript, these web skimmers attempt to exfiltrate information to threat actors in a variety of ways. The usage of C2 servers is one of the more popular methods, although direct collection cannot be ruled out. Code can be presented in myriad ways - it can even appear to be nearly identical to other skimmers with only minor changes to code. Detection of the skimmers is usually accomplished via IDS/IPS in the form of patterns generated by skimmers. Once a pattern can be identified, the signature of the skimmer can be written and implemented into the IDS/IPS. This method of detection is not without its flaws. Obfuscation of code and changes in code can make this process much more difficult for the security professional. Constantly changing IPs and C2 servers makes logging and blocking of these nearly impossible.
