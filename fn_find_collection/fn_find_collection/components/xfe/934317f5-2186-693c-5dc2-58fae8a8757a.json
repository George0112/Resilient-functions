            "description": "# Summary\n\nIBM X-Force observed a new spam campaign that, after a few hiccups, started distributing emails with the popular Agent Tesla malware as an attachment. In this campaign threat actors try to lure recipients with an invitation to bid for a well known manufacturing company.\n\n# Threat Type\n\nRAT, Malware, Spam\n\n# Overview\n\nThe prospect of investing in a well known company or just plain curiosity can drive targets of this campaign to inadvertently become part of a botnet powered by the Agent Tesla malware. It seems however that some early invitees were deprived of this possibility by emails containing only empty promises and no attachments. Threat actors seem to have spotted their mistake late Saturday and swiftly resumed operations first thing Monday, after resting for the Sunday.\n\n# Description\n\nIn a recent analysis IBM X-Force discovered an email with an invitation to become bidders in a well known manufacturing company. The following screenshot shows a recent sample email from this campaign.\n\n /api/casefiles/934317f52186693c5dc258fae8a8757a/attachments/934317f52186693c5dc258fae8ac99b0/6f0169def48d9d43037c\n\nUnfortunately for the fictitious \"Mr. Alfred Wilson\", he made the all-too-common mistake of not including the attachment in the first batch of invitations. The distinctive blue font was never forgotten, however. The following timeline shows the observed mail volume from the last few days.\n\n /api/casefiles/934317f52186693c5dc258fae8a8757a/attachments/53d16679e83155dc9db9a5f192e2e1ed/2adfc4ae3ea101403b9a\n\nThe campaign began on Saturday with innocuous emails lacking their proper Agent Tesla attachment. After taking a rest on Sunday, the spam resumed on Monday fixing its mistake after a few hours. \n\nThe early complications of this campaign do not reduce the actual danger of its payload. The attachment is a compressed file containing an executable that promptly drops Agent Tesla into its host. The next image shows the  graph of this process.\n\n /api/casefiles/934317f52186693c5dc258fae8a8757a/attachments/46f09ac4ccb7ddcfc4b565f8b3d2c857/660367300a6d8ba8256c\n\nThe dropped malware connects to mail.subzerosolution.com using the SMTP protocol, which is a known Agent Tesla behavior. Further analysis of the main domain reveals it to be an Apache server showing an open directory. Since the Whois record of this domain is a decade old this suggests that threat actors are taking advantage of a misconfigured server.\n\n## September 8th update\n\nWe observed a change in the attachment of the emails that distribute the Agent Tesla malware. The email and the infection process are identical but the attachment file name no longer contains the trailing underscore as shown above. In timeline below you can visualize the distribution of both attachments differentiated by the bar color.\n\n /api/casefiles/934317f52186693c5dc258fae8a8757a/attachments/126be11221a152d1727bd2a4a87cbb7d/e037843c024d25717a8d\n\n## September 10th update\n\nWe observed several more email templates distributing Agent Tesla using the same technique described above. The  emails continue to show the admiration threat actors have for blue fonts, although they boldly experiment with different tones. The new variants being distributed with these emails connect to different C2 servers.

            "collectionWikiContent": "Summary\nIBM X-Force observed a new spam campaign that, after a few hiccups, started distributing emails with the popular Agent Tesla malware as an attachment. In this campaign threat actors try to lure recipients with an invitation to bid for a well known manufacturing company.\nThreat Type\nRAT, Malware, Spam\nOverview\nThe prospect of investing in a well known company or just plain curiosity can drive targets of this campaign to inadvertently become part of a botnet powered by the Agent Tesla malware. It seems however that some early invitees were deprived of this possibility by emails containing only empty promises and no attachments. Threat actors seem to have spotted their mistake late Saturday and swiftly resumed operations first thing Monday, after resting for the Sunday.\nDescription\nIn a recent analysis IBM X-Force discovered an email with an invitation to become bidders in a well known manufacturing company. The following screenshot shows a recent sample email from this campaign.\n \nUnfortunately for the fictitious \"Mr. Alfred Wilson\", he made the all-too-common mistake of not including the attachment in the first batch of invitations. The distinctive blue font was never forgotten, however. The following timeline shows the observed mail volume from the last few days.\n\n \nThe campaign began on Saturday with innocuous emails lacking their proper Agent Tesla attachment. After taking a rest on Sunday, the spam resumed on Monday fixing its mistake after a few hours. \nThe early complications of this campaign do not reduce the actual danger of its payload. The attachment is a compressed file containing an executable that promptly drops Agent Tesla into its host. The next image shows the  graph of this process.\n \nThe dropped malware connects to mail.subzerosolution.com using the SMTP protocol, which is a known Agent Tesla behavior. Further analysis of the main domain reveals it to be an Apache server showing an open directory. Since the Whois record of this domain is a decade old this suggests that threat actors are taking advantage of a misconfigured server.\nSeptember 8th update\nWe observed a change in the attachment of the emails that distribute the Agent Tesla malware. The email and the infection process are identical but the attachment file name no longer contains the trailing underscore as shown above. In timeline below you can visualize the distribution of both attachments differentiated by the bar color.\n \nSeptember 10th update\nWe observed several more email templates distributing Agent Tesla using the same technique described above. The  emails continue to show the admiration threat actors have for blue fonts, although they boldly experiment with different tones.
